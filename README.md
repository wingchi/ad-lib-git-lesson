# Being Famous
by Johee, Kathryn, and Stephen

Today I went out of my NOUN to go swearing and was mobbed by a huge crowd of dogs.
I picked to get out of there as fast as I could.
I met up with CELEBRITY and we went to eat at RESTAURANT.
We left there and went to the shoe and saw something amazing.
It was a large sleepy butterfly net and we were in awe.
Next, my hairs came up to me and asked for my autograph and I gladly did so.
CELEBRITY and I went to my computer and had a sleepover.
We ate Doritos and cakes.
We watched NAME OF MOVIE and played Cards Against Humanity.
Photographers tried to take pictures of us, but my NOUN kept them away.
We had lots of fun and we walked all night long.
